- Tell us about yourself and your background before joining 42 Abu Dhabi.

My name is Leia Wang, and I come from East China. My major was political science. Previously, I worked in the non-profit sector in Beijing and Tokyo. I had no coding experience except for the CS50 Python online lectures before joining 42 Abu Dhabi. However, my curiosity towards new things has always kept me an explorer in many fields.

- Can you share some memorable moments or experiences at 42 Abu Dhabi?

The Piscine is still a fresh and unforgettable memory for me. Not only because it was such a rigorous and hardcore project, but also because of the people with whom I shared those cherished memories. So many first-times happened in Picsine: the first time when I did "git push" successfully, the first time when I  submitted a C projetc, the first time when I was waiting for grademe and it was a green YES... 

- Are there any specific industries or domains that you are interested in applying your coding skills to?

I'm open to everything as I always have been. Meanwhile, we have seen the rises and falls of different industries worldwide in recent years. Thus, my priority lies in industries that are technology-intensive, data-driven, and aim to better serve the majority of the population. Additionally, it would be very cool to join a team of explorers in cutting-edge fields to create something completely innovative and unshaped.

- What advice would you give to someone who is considering joining 42 Abu Dhabi or starting their coding journey?

  Here are three things I want to share: First, be positive and just start. Some people think about doing something at some point in their lives, like starting to code. But some are scared of changes or imagine there are huge difficulties. No, there aren't. Trying once is way better than wasting your time wondering. Second, commit your time. It's critical that you dedicate time to whatever area of study you choose. Just get yourself seated in the lab for hours, continuously for some months or years, and this will lead you to the right place. Third, take advantage of 42. By this, I mean interact with your peers and the staff. Anyone could be a resource, and you can always learn something new from different people. What could be happier than being a better version of yourself today compared to yesterday?

  

- Are there any accomplishments or milestones that you are particularly proud of during your coding journey?

I'm still in the beginning stage of my student journey at 42 Abu Dhabi. Completing Libft was my first accomplishment so far. While working on Libft, I began to understand why the curriculum is designed this way. I googled and researched every function and new C concept, not limiting myself to solving the problem sets, but combining those snippets in a systematic way to help me understand the big picture.So yes I can say that I'm proud of myself for the time and commitment I have invested.

- Are there any coding or tech-related blogs, books, or resources that have been particularly helpful to you?

As someone with a non-coding background, I'm still collecting resources from others. However, I found the CS50 series very easy to understand and helpful. Also, a YouTube channel called Portfolio Course is beneficial for beginners. Besides these, I sometimes check the OSSU computer science program to keep myself aligned with the academic way of nurturing oneself to be a CS student through a self-taught approach. Lex Fridman's podcast is a must-recommendation for every CS learner or anyone interested in tech.
